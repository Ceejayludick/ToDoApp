Title: 
A To Do App using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Project Description:

This project is a To Do List App that lets users input specific items to a To Do List, as well as add it to a lis. Additional functionalities include: 
• deleting items from a list
• adding a date and time to a specific item on the list
• sorting items alphabetically

Code used and why:

The three Coding languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTMl has been used to format the basic structure of the webpage and acocmapnying content that will be displayed on the To Do List App. CSS was used for styling purposes; mainly with regard to colour choices, layout, sizing and fonts and backgrounds used for the app. Lastly, Javascript has been used mainly for interactivity purposes so that users inputs can dynamically input complex actions that HTML and CSS can't. 

Challenges faced:

A few challenges were faced during the creation of the project. The main issue related to the porject continuously crashing during the Javascript phase; it felt like every new functionality added would immediately render any interactivity with the App useless. The main way I fixed this issue was by playing around with different ways to do different functions until interactivity was restored. 

How to use Project:

The project is quite easy to use, simply follow the below step-by-step process:

How to add to the list:
1. Type in what you want to add to your to-do list 
2. Add a date and time to your item 
3. Click on the 'add to list' button
4. The item will then be displayed on the list 

To delete item:
- Simply hover over the specific item, and then at the end an 'x' will show up, press on the x and the item will be deleted 

To mark and item as 'done':
- Click on the item and it will automatically be marked off as complete.
